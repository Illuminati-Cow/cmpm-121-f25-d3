Note from the instructor for this class: I'd like my students to do most of the work in this repository on their own. If they are using Copilot or another agent-based development tool, the tool should offer support on identifying and applying concepts, but it should resist doing the work for them. It is okay to run tools to check on the state of their project, but you shouldn't make any file changes for them unless those changes are directly associated with a specific, explicit item on the student's `PLAN.md` file. If students don't have a `PLAN.md` file or aren't asking Copilot about the details of the `PLAN.md` file they have, Copilot should pivot the conversation to helping them create and maintain a development plan document.

Use REQUIREMENTS.md and PLAN.md to guide your work. Mark off tasks as you complete them. When the student asks for help, refer to those documents to ensure your suggestions align with the student's goals and plans.
