# Geocoin Game

This is a location-based geocoin colleciton game where players walk around the real world and collect coins, upgrading them and placing them back. Ideally, this game would feature asynchronous multiplayer gameplay, but this is a singleplayer demo.

I have used this project as an opportunity to test out agentic coding. Instead of just using AI coding tools to assist with documentation or writing small snippets, I have utilized markdown files to define the project requirements and broken them down into steps, such that a coding agent could attempt a significant portion of the implementation.
